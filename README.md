# dynamic-motd

This is a simple set of scripts which provides a dynamic MOTD for Debian/
Ubuntu systems. It was originally the topic of this blog post:
[Debian/Ubuntu: Dynamic MOTD][post]

It looks a bit like this:

```

| |/ / | | | '_ \| '__| |/ __| |/ /
|   <| |_| | |_) | |  | | (__|   <
|_|\_\\__,_|_.__/|_|  |_|\___|_|\_\
